Ingredients:
-8 shallots
-3 cloves garlic
-10 Thai bird chilies (adjust the amount to your spiciness preference)
-1 inch fresh ginger, peeled
-1/2 inch fresh turmeric, peeled
-5 kaffir lime leaves, shredded
-2 stalks lemongrass, white part only, bruised
-1 large tomatoes, chopped
-1 pound pork shoulder, cubed
-2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-1/2 teaspoon sugar
-salt and pepper to taste

Directions:

1. Using a food processor, grind the first 6 ingredients until they form (slightly) chunky paste. 

2. Heat vegetable oil in a large, thick-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Stir fry the spice paste until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 

3. Add pork cubes into skillet, then lemongrass, tomatoes and some sugar. Mix until well blended. Bring to boil. 

4. Reduce the heat to low, continue to simmer, stirring occasionally (add some water if the sauce becomes too dry), until the pork is tender and the sauce thickens, about 1 hour. 

5. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot with steamed rice.
